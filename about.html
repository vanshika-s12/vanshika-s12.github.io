  # About Me

  I’m Vanshika, a student deeply passionate about science, AI, machine learning, and research—motivated to build, learn, and solve real-world problems.

  ## Projects

  - **Quantum Temporal Lattice Theory (QTL):** Published a peer-reviewed paper exploring localized time manipulation via quantum mechanics, string theory, and holographic encoding (IJSAT).
  - **Spam Email Classifier:** Developed a Python ML tool that detects spam using Scikit-learn, regex features, and model evaluation metrics.
  - **Simple Sentiment Analyzer:** Built an ML model (logistic regression) to classify sentence sentiment, with regex-powered preprocessing and accuracy/loss visualizations.
  - **File Name Pattern Finder:** Created a tool that scans directories and uses regex/ML to classify files by pattern (log, data, etc.).
  - **Handwritten Digit Recognizer (MNIST):** Used neural networks (Keras/Scikit-learn) to train and visualize digit classification and errors.
  - **CMD Error Detector and Fixer:** Won 2nd prize and ₹7,000 in a hackathon for building a CLI tool to diagnose and suggest fixes for Windows CMD errors.

  ## Achievements

  - Awarded 90% scholarship at PW for academic excellence (2023).
  - Published research paper on Quantum Temporal Lattice (QTL) in IJSAT (2025).
  - Won First Prize in school science exhibition for the most innovative and impactful project (2024).
  - Secured 2nd position in Nav Sadhana Singing Competition among thousands of competitors.
  - Participated in national-level spell bees and was invited to India’s Got Talent.
  - Raised donations for visually and hearing-impaired children through volunteering.

  ## Experience

  - **Summer Student, The Indian Vidyarthi (2024):** Engaged in workshops on global issues, wrote on urban water management, and worked on sustainability and business innovation.
  - **Science Exhibition Winner:** Consistently presented impactful projects, demonstrating creativity and critical thinking.
  - **Junior AI Evangelist, Lawroom AI:** Supported automation in legal AI workflows, improved model accuracy, and contributed to prompt engineering.
  - **Community Hardware Troubleshooter:** Diagnosed and fixed BIOS/CPU issues for local users (2017–2022).
